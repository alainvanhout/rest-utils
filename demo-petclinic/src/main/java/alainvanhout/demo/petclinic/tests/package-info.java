/**
 * Tests are divided into packages based on
 * - the url paths: e.g. 'pets' for GET /pets
 * - the url path parameters: e.g. _id for {id} in GET /pets/{id}
 * - the http methods/verb: e.g. __post for the POST in POST /pets/{id}{}
 *
 * These are nothing more that useful conventions, from which can be deviated without effect.
