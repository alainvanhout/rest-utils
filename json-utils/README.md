# json-utils

This module provides interfaces for building library implementation that allow the straightforward and convenient conversions to and from JSON.

The [http-utils](https://github.com/alainvanhout/rest-utils/tree/master/http-utils) module makes use of this to provide easy interaction with JSON-based http endpoints. There is however no direct dependency or usage link from json-utils to http-utils, i.e. a specific json-utils implementation can be used entirely indendently of the other modules of the [rest-utils](https://github.com/alainvanhout/rest-utils) project.
